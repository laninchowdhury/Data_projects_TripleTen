# Used Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of a used car based on various features using regression models.

## 🧩 Problem
Buying or selling used cars is tricky without knowing fair prices. This project aims to build a model that predicts car prices accurately.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🔄 Process Overview
- **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, corrected types
- **EDA** – Analyzed features affecting price
- **Modeling** – Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation** – RMSE, R² Score

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest
- **Top Predictors**: Car age, mileage, brand

## 📁 Files
- `Used_Car_Price.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `images/` – Visual charts

## 📊 Visuals
