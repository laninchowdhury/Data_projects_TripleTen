# Oil Well Profitability

This project evaluates oil well investments to determine which wells are profitable using statistical modeling and regression.

## 🧠 Problem

Oil companies need to decide whether to keep investing in specific wells. Poor decisions can lead to major financial losses.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔄 Process Overview

1. **Data Exploration** – Reviewed oil well attributes & profitability  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Created features like ROI, cost-to-profit ratio  
3. **Modeling** – Used Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
4. **Evaluation** – Compared models using R² and RMSE  
5. **Business Insights** – Identified wells with high ROI and cost drivers

## 📈 Results

- Best model: Random Forest with R² of 0.87  
- Key insights: Region, equipment cost, and volume affect ROI  
- Business value: Helped avoid low-performing wells
