## üîç Projects Included

1. [Customer Churn Prediction](./Customer_Churn_Prediction)  
   Predicts which customers are likely to churn using classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Key metric: F1 Score optimization.

2. [IMDB Sentiment Classification](./IMDB_Sentiment_Classification)  
   NLP project classifying movie reviews using TF-IDF and logistic regression. Achieved 0.87 F1 score on test data with balanced review polarity.

3. [Taxi Demand Forecasting](./Taxi_Demand_and_Forecasting)  
   Forecasts taxi demand using time series techniques (ARIMA, SARIMA). Emphasizes data resampling, stationarity, and model evaluation.

4. [Oil Well Profitability](./Oil_Well_Profitability)  
   Predicts profitability of oil wells using regression and business KPIs. Focus on exploratory data analysis and investment decision-making.

5. [Used Car Price Prediction](./Used_Car_Price)  
   Regression models to predict car prices based on condition, mileage, model, and engine features. Used cross-validation and feature engineering.

6. [BetaBank Churn Prediction](./BetaBank_Churn_Prdiction)  
   Advanced churn prediction using multiple classifiers. Emphasis on improving F1 score with balanced accuracy, precision, and recall.
